    Exception Handling

    error  vs exception
    exception: can be handled
    error: fatal and application times out

    mechanism that handles runtime errors so  that  normal
    flow of application can be  maintained

    exception: event that disrupts the normal flow of  the
    program
    object thrown at runtime

    EH allows one to maintaint normal  flow of application

    throwable class is root   class of java exception hierachy
    throwable is inherited by error and  exception

    1. Error
        a. stack overflow
        b.Virtual machine
        c.Out of memory

    2. Exception
        a.IO
        b.SQL
        c. Class not  found

     Types  of exceptions
        1. Checked
            inherit throwable class
            checked at compile time (IO,SQL, and Class not found)
        2. Unchecked
            inherit Runtime  Exception
                checked at runtime (ArrayIndexOutOfBound etc)
         3. Error is irrecoverable

      Java Exception Keywords

      try: specifies block where we should place exception code
            must be followed by catch or finally
            if  try is executed (code  works)  only the try
            will run, not the catch

      catch(Exception e):  used to handle  exception
              must be preceded  by try block
              can be followed by finally block

      finally: used to  execute important code of  program
                executed wether exce ption is  handled or not

      throw: used to throw an exception

      throws: used to declare exceptions
               specifies that there may occur an exception
               in  the method
               always used  as method signature
